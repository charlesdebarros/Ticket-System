Agatha Christie is the worldâ€™s best known mystery writer. Her books have sold over a billion
copies in the English language and another billion in 44 foreign languages. She is the most
widely published author of all time in any language, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare.
Her writing career spanned more than half a century, during which she wrote 79 novels and
short story collections, as well as 14 plays, one of which, The Mousetrap, is the longest-running
play in history. Two of the characters she created, the brilliant little Belgian Hercule Poirot and
the irrepressible and relentless Miss Marple, went on to become world-famous detectives. Both
have been widely dramatized in feature films and made-for-TV movies.
Agatha Christie also wrote six romantic novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. As
well, she wrote four nonfiction books including an autobiography and an entertaining account of
the many expeditions she shared with her archaeologist husband Sir Max Mallowan.
Agatha Christie died in 1976.
